# The NeoDefaults Installer for Team Fortress 2
NeoDefaults is a no-nonsense config installer for
[Team Fortress 2](https://store.steampowered.com/app/440/Team_Fortress_2/) that updates the game
with the best default settings. It is fast, seamless, easy to use, and only needs to be run once to
take advantage of settings that will instantly improve the game experience. All changes that
NeoDefaults makes are fully supported by Valve and are not considered exploits.

## Download and Install
The fastest way to improve your game settings with NeoDefaults will take less than a minute.
1. Download the latest [release](https://github.com/kqarryzada/NeoDefaults/releases).
1. Unzip the folder and run the `.exe` file.
1. Select "Basic Installation" and install the files.

That's it. After this, you're ready to launch TF2 and take advantage of the new settings.

## Minimum Requirements
NeoDefaults is currently suported for Windows 8, Windows 10, and Windows 11 systems.

## Why Use NeoDefaults?
Team Fortress 2's default settings are horribly out-of-date, and terrible for new players.
Fortunately, TF2 is extremely customizable, so these bad settings can be (and are) easily
changed by seasoned players. However, this can make things worse for new players, because they are
now using completely different settings than their opponents, putting them at a disadvantage.

This program solves this issue by changing the game settings to a set of "new defaults". NeoDefaults
only focuses on necessary changes and avoids anything that could infringe on personal preference.
Some of the changes include:
* Disabling mouse acceleration to help with aim
* Improving network settings to make the game more responsive
* Updating the FOV settings so that the screen is less obscured

The installer does the work for changing game settings and graphics for you. For details on how the
NeoDefaults Installer accomplishes this, see [How It Works](docs/More-Info.md#how-it-works).

## What Gets Changed
The most noticeable differences are probably the settings related to the FOV and viewmodel:
![Soldier FOV changes](

With the default settings, the Sniper is nearly invisible because the viewmodel covers his body.
Furthermore, the perspective in NeoDefaults has a larger field of view. This means that more of the
area can be seen (e.g., the +/- on the left, the windows at the top, etc.).

NeoDefaults also improves damage numbers. Ordinarily, this critical information is tiny and hard to
read:

Notice that NeoDefaults enables `hud_combattext_batching` in the image on the right, so the
individual damage numbers are automatically summed together.
