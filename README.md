# neodefaults-staging
The default settings for Team Fortress 2 are very out of date. The goal of this project is to create an installer that seamlessly adds much-needed config files and customizations. This is intended to provide a very easy way for new players to jump into the game without having unideal settings. The current components planned are:
* An updated `autoexec.cfg` file with cherry-picked customizations of in-game settings
* The custom hitsound file from Quake
* A new HUD
