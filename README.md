# The NeoDefaults Installer for Team Fortress 2
NeoDefaults is a no-nonsense config installer for
[Team Fortress 2](https://store.steampowered.com/app/440/Team_Fortress_2/) that updates the game
with the best default settings. It is fast, seamless, easy to use, and only needs to be run once to
take advantage of settings that will instantly improve the game experience. All changes that
NeoDefaults makes are fully supported by Valve and are not considered exploits.

## Download and Install
The fastest way to improve your game settings with NeoDefaults will take less than a minute.
1. Download the latest [release](https://github.com/kqarryzada/NeoDefaults/releases).
1. Unzip the folder and run the `.exe` file.
1. Select "Basic Installation" and install the files.

That's it. After this, you're ready to launch TF2 and take advantage of the new settings.

## Minimum Requirements
NeoDefaults is currently supported for Windows 8, Windows 10, and Windows 11 systems.

## Why Use NeoDefaults?
Playing TF2 without changing any of the settings is like trying to rip your teeth out with your bare
hands. The default settings are horribly out-of-date, and terrible for new players. Fortunately, TF2
is extremely customizable, so these bad settings are easily changed by seasoned players... but this
puts new players at a huge disadvantage.

This program solves this issue by updating the game settings to a set of "new defaults". NeoDefaults
only focuses on necessary changes and avoids anything that could infringe on personal preference.
Some of the changes include:
* Disabling mouse acceleration to help with aim
* Improving network settings to make the game more responsive
* Updating the FOV settings so that the screen is less obscured

## What Gets Changed
The most noticeable differences are probably the settings related to the FOV and viewmodel:

With the default settings, the Sniper is nearly invisible because the rocket launcher blocks his
body. Furthermore, the perspective in NeoDefaults has a larger field of view. This means that more
of the area can be seen (e.g., the +/- on the left, the windows at the top, etc.).

NeoDefaults also improves damage numbers. Ordinarily, this critical information is tiny and hard to
read:

Notice that NeoDefaults enables "batching" of the damage, so the damage numbers are automatically
added up.
