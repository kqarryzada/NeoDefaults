// NeoDefaults config, alpha version

// Some commands in this file that require cheats to be enabled, for whatever reason. They are
// turned off at the end of the file.
sv_cheats 1


//---------------
// Mouse settings
//---------------
// Disable mouse acceleration.
//
// Turning mouse acceleration off means that moving your mouse from one spot on the mousepad to
// another will always move your character's view the same amount, no matter how fast or slow you
// move the mouse between those two points. This makes building muscle memory much easier, and your
// aim will improve much faster than if acceleration was enabled.
m_rawinput 1
m_filter 0
m_customaccel 0
m_mouseaccel1 0
m_mouseaccel2 0


//---------------
// Network settings
//---------------
// Defines client-side interpolation.
//
// Interpolation adds artifical latency to the client (i.e., your TF2 game) to make the game feel
// smooth even if there are network issues like packet loss.
//
// 0.0303 is a value that favors hitscan weapons, whereas projectile-based weapons can benefit more
// from setting this to 0. For new players, lowering this to at least 0.0303 (from 0.1) is good
// enough. In any case, this is something that should be set once and left alone.
cl_interp 0.0303
cl_interp_ratio 2

// These define the maximum number of packets per second that are sent to and requested from the
// server. They have been increased from the default values of 20 and 30, respectively, to make the
// game feel more responsive.
cl_updaterate 67
cl_cmdrate 67

// Do not ever change these values. They are set by default, but it doesn't hurt to double-check and
// enable them here just in case.
cl_lagcompensation 1
cl_pred_optimize 2


//---------------
// Class-specific settings
//---------------
// Disable automatic re-zoom upon firing a scoped shot
cl_autorezoom 0

// TF2 was made for 4:3 screens, so by default, most players notice that moving the mouse while
// scoped feels sluggish. This scales the scoped sensitivity to feel more normal for 16:9 screens.
zoom_sensitivity_ratio 0.833333

// Play a sound when a shot is fully charged
tf_sniper_fullcharge_bell 1

// When disabled, a player must hold left-click down to continue healing.
tf_medigun_autoheal 1

// This allows disguising using only the 1, 2, and 3 keys on the keyboard (as opposed to the
// default, which requires 1-9).
tf_simple_disguise_menu 1


//---------------
// FOV/Viewmodel settings
//---------------
// Increase the FOV, allowing the player to see more of what's happening around them.
fov_desired 90

// Change the FOV of the viewmodel, both in-game and when viewing demos.
viewmodel_fov 70
viewmodel_fov_demo 70

// Enable minimal viewmodels so that the weapons don't cover as much of the screen.
tf_use_min_viewmodels 1


//---------------
// Damage numbers
//---------------
// Set the damage number colors to be yellow. If idHUD is installed, this will allow damage numbers
// to match the ones displayed in the bottom left of the screen.
hud_combattext_red 255
hud_combattext_green 255
hud_combattext_blue 77

// Display damage numbers above the heads of enemies. Batching is enabled so that TF2 automatically
// adds up these numbers for you.
hud_combattext 1
hud_combattext_batching 1
hud_combattext_batching_window 2


//---------------
// Hitsound
//---------------
// These are the pitch values from b4nny's config. If you want to disable hitsounds, set
// 'tf_dingalingaling' to 0 in the custom.cfg file.
tf_dingalingaling 1
tf_dingaling_volume 0.6
tf_dingaling_pitchmindmg 140
tf_dingaling_pitchmaxdmg 5

// These values affect the killsound, i.e., the sound file that is played when you get a kill.
// NeoDefaults disables this, and just plays a hitsound like normal.
tf_dingalingaling_lasthit 0


//---------------
// Miscellaneous
//---------------
// Enable the minimal HUD. The main benefit to this is that bars like the cloak meter are much
// bigger and are a better indicator of how fast something is recharging.
cl_hud_minmode 1

// Enable fast weapon switch. If disabled, a player will need to perform an additional left-click to
// confirm every time they switch weapons, which is unnecessary.
hud_fastswitch 1

// Enable the developer console. This can be opened in-game with the "~" key and allows for any
// commands, such as the ones in this file, to be typed in and executed.
con_enable 1

// Health values of other players are displayed next to their username, since this is easier to read
// than numbers floating above each player's head. This will prevent you from seeing the health of
// large bots in Mann vs. Machine, however.
tf_hud_target_id_disable_floating_health 1

// Re-bind crouch to SHIFT
bind SHIFT "+duck"
unbind CTRL
