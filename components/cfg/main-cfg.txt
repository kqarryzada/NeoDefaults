//---------------
// Mouse settings
//---------------
// Disable mouse acceleration.
//
// Turning mouse acceleration off means that moving your mouse from one spot on the mousepad to
// another will always move your character's view the same amount, no matter how fast or slow you
// move the mouse between those two points. This makes building muscle memory much easier, and your
// aim will improve much faster than if acceleration was enabled.
m_rawinput 1
m_mousespeed 0

// These values are already set by default, but are still placed here just in case.
m_filter 0
m_customaccel 0
m_mouseaccel1 0
m_mouseaccel2 0


//---------------
// Network settings
//---------------
// Defines client-side interpolation.
//
// Interpolation adds artifical latency to the client (i.e., your TF2 game) to make the game feel
// smooth even if there are network issues like packet loss. For more information on this, visit the
// FAQ on GitHub.
cl_interp 0.0303
cl_interp_ratio 2

// The maximum number of packets per second that are sent to and received from the server. They have
// been increased from the default of 20 and 30, respectively, to make the game more responsive.
cl_updaterate 67
cl_cmdrate 67


//---------------
// Class-specific settings
//---------------
// Disable automatic re-zoom of the sniper rifle when firing a scoped shot.
cl_autorezoom 0

// TF2 was made for 4:3 screens, so by default, most players notice that moving the mouse while
// scoped feels sluggish. This scales the scoped sensitivity to feel more normal for 16:9 screens.
zoom_sensitivity_ratio 0.833333

// Play a sound when a shot is fully charged on the sniper rifle.
tf_sniper_fullcharge_bell 1

// When disabled, a player must hold left-click down to continue healing.
tf_medigun_autoheal 1

// This allows disguising using only the 1, 2, and 3 keys on the keyboard (as opposed to the
// default, which requires 1-9).
tf_simple_disguise_menu 1


//---------------
// FOV (Field of View)/Viewmodel settings
//---------------
// Increase the FOV, allowing the player to see more of what's happening around them.
fov_desired 90

// Change the FOV of the viewmodel, both in-game and when viewing demos.
viewmodel_fov 70
viewmodel_fov_demo 70

// Enable minimal viewmodels so that the weapons don't cover as much of the screen.
tf_use_min_viewmodels 1


//---------------
// Damage numbers
//---------------
// Set the damage number colors to be yellow. Yellow is a good choice because it's easy to read the
// numbers, regardless of what's in the background.
hud_combattext_red 255
hud_combattext_green 255
hud_combattext_blue 77

// Display damage numbers above the heads of enemies. "Batching" is enabled so that TF2
// automatically adds up these numbers for you if you hit an opponent more than once.
hud_combattext 1
hud_combattext_batching 1
hud_combattext_batching_window 2


//---------------
// Hitsound
//---------------
// These are the pitch values from b4nny's config. If you want to disable hitsounds, set
// 'tf_dingalingaling' to 0 in the custom.cfg file.
tf_dingalingaling 1
tf_dingaling_volume 0.6
tf_dingaling_pitchmindmg 140
tf_dingaling_pitchmaxdmg 5


//---------------
// Miscellaneous
//---------------
// Enable fast weapon switch. If disabled, a player will need to perform an additional left-click to
// confirm every time they switch weapons, which is clunky and unnecessary.
hud_fastswitch 1

// Enable the developer console. This can be opened in-game with the "`" key. This key is above the
// TAB character, and allows for any commands, such as the ones in this file, to be typed in and
// executed.
con_enable 1

// Display health values of teammates next to their username. This is generally easier to read than
// the default setting, where health numbers instead float above each player's head.
//
// Note that this will prevent you from seeing the health of large bots in Mann vs. Machine,
// however. Type 'mvm' and 'mvmOff' in the console to swap this setting while in-game.
tf_hud_target_id_disable_floating_health 1
alias mvm "tf_hud_target_id_disable_floating_health 0; echo; echo Floating health enabled for MvM. Type 'mvmOff' to disable."
alias mvmOff "tf_hud_target_id_disable_floating_health 1; echo; echo Floating health for MvM has been disabled."

// Set SHIFT to be the "crouch" key. Crouching with the CTRL key is much harder, especially when
// rocket jumping.
bind SHIFT "+duck"
unbind CTRL


//---------------
// Custom player settings
//---------------
// Execute 'custom.cfg' to run all customized settings. This is done as the last step so that any
// undesired changes that are set in this file can be overridden.
