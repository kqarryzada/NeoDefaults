// NeoDefaults config, alpha version

// Enable cheats before beginning. Some commands in this file that require cheats to be enabled, for
// whatever reason. This setting will be disabled at the end of the file.
sv_cheats 1

//--- Damage numbers ---//
// Display damage numbers above the heads of enemies. Batching is enabled so that TF2 automatically
// adds up these numbers for you.
hud_combattext 1
hud_combattext_batching 1
hud_combattext_batching_window 2

//--- Mouse settings ---//
// Disable mouse acceleration entirely.
m_rawinput 1
mat_vsync 0
m_filter 0
m_customaccel 0
m_mouseaccel1 0
m_mouseaccel2 0

// Rebind mouse keys
// unbind "1"
// unbind "2"
// unbind "3"
unbind "q"
// bind MOUSE1 "+attack"
// bind MOUSE2 "+attack2"
// bind MOUSE3 "+attack3"
// bind MOUSE4     "slot1"
// bind MOUSE5     "slot2"
// bind MWHEELDOWN "slot3"

//--- Network settings ---//
// These are set by default, but it's good to set these upon the game's startup in case they are
// ever overriden for any reason. Do not ever change these values; they are critically important.
cl_lagcompensation 1
cl_pred_optimize 2


//--- Sniper rifle settings ---//
// Disable automatic re-zoom upon firing a scoped shot
cl_autorezoom 0

// Play a sound when a shot is fully charged
tf_sniper_fullcharge_bell 1

// This scales the scoped sensitivity to be identical to the unscoped sensitivity for 16:9
// resolutions. TF2 was made for 4:3 screens, which causes this slower sensitivity upon zooming when
// playing on modern monitors. If you use a 4:3 resolution, you should set this value to "1" in the
// override file.
zoom_sensitivity_ratio 0.833333


//--- Other class-specific settings ---//
// Enable auto-heal for the medi gun. When disabled, a player must hold left-click down to continue
// healing.
tf_medigun_autoheal 1

// Enable the concise disguise menu for the Spy. This allows disguising as classes using only the
// 1, 2, and 3 keys on the keyboard (as opposed to the default, which requires 1-9).
tf_simple_disguise_menu 1


//--- FOV/Viewmodel settings ---//
// Change the FOV from the awful default of 54, allowing the player to see more of what's happening
// around them. If your PC struggles to run TF2, you can consider lowering this to 70 so that there
// is less content to render.
fov_desired 90

// Enable min viewmodels so that the weapons don't cover as much of the screen.
tf_use_min_viewmodels 1

// Change the FOV of the viewmodel, both in-game and when viewing demos.
viewmodel_fov 90
viewmodel_fov_demo 90


//--- Miscellaneous ---//
// Enable fast weapon switch. This setting is crucial for this fast-paced game. If disabled, a
// player will need to perform an additional left-click to confirm every time they switch weapons.
hud_fastswitch 1

// Enable the developer console. This can be opened in-game with the "~" key and allows for any
// commands, such as the ones in this file, to be typed in and executed.
con_enable 1

// Enable automatic reloading when not firing a weapon. There are almost no scenarios in which
// having this disabled is a good idea.
cl_autoreload 1

// Whenever changing weapons/loadouts in spawn, automatically respawn with the new loadout changes.
tf_respawn_on_loadoutchanges 1

// Enable stats for the upcoming wave in Mann vs Machine.
cl_mvm_wave_status_visible_during_wave 1

// Re-bind crouch to SHIFT
bind SHIFT "+duck"
unbind CTRL
